AIM: 
  Trains FFNN for modulo-2 function using different algrithms and 
  compares their performance

INPUT: 
  Set the no. of hidden layers in FFNN
  Set the Algorithm parameters

OUTPUT:
  The error convergence can be plotted using plot(err_<algo>)
  Trained NNs are saved in NN_<algo>
  Output of NNs for all patterns can be tested using test(NN_<algo>,data)

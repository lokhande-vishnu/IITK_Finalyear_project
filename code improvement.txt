//either  Codes taking infinite time to run or not running at all
1. Mark the times and run a reduced version of the code
code breakin
2. observe the toolbox and modify the mathematics
convert matrices to for loops and for loops to matrices

the toolbox is running at thunderous speed as compared to my codes
+ it is performing in batch 

comparison
here
one epoch is taking ~ 10 hours

there
one epoch is taking ~ 1 minute

BETTER MY CODE

problems in my code
.v extension is added just to prevent predeclaration
It is array of data structures. Basically an arrray wherin each cell is a data structure
i.e. each cell has one or more fields.
1. jacobina is taking unnecessary extra time
claim is that those 10 are independent thus remove those ten
2. All weights are put in the form of a matrix and hence lot of space
Convert all the arrays into data structures or cells

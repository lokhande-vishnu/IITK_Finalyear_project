ii) The introduction should motivate the problem, talk about previous work and propose solution. I don't have any comments on the aforementioned structure,
but the use of I.A seems out of context in the introduction. Especially since most of the variables are given without proper quantification. Please remove Figure 2.
In page 3 in the first paragraph, the reviewer does not agree that the derivation of HJB is simple and straightforward. HJB is a PDE without a closed-form solution and also
suffers from the curst of dimensionality.
//Nothing technical


The authors should also check some approximate dynamic programming work on HJB,
i.e.

// please check these things
// One has to be infinite convergence while the other has to be finite convergence.

iii) Now after a good introduction the reviewer expects to see a section on problem formulation to make clear the problem considered by the authors. All the equations are provided without proper quantification and definition. In
subsection II.A there is a big mistake. Since the authors are considering (13) which is a finite-horizon problem, (15) cannot be written like this but it has to be written as,
$-\frac{\partial V(e(t))}{\partial t}=\min_u (L+\frac{\partial V}{\partial e}\dot{e})$. Also the matrix $R$ needs to be positive definite. Meaning that everything has to be changed from (15) and onwards.
Now let us say that (13) was infinite horizon then the authors need to formulate (16)-(27) in lemmas and/or theorems. The connection between the previous equations and (28) and (29) is not clear.
Do the authors need to start with an admissible control?
iv) Similarly the authors need to provide math guarantees and technical results for all their equations. The experiments seem nice but I think they are not enough to value a publication in a prestigious journal such as
IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics.
//If it is a finite horizon problem, then evthg has to be changed
// if it is an infinite horizon problem then formulate(write it in a systematic way) them with lemmas and/or theorems.
